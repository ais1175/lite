## Hosting Options

### Docker Compose
For production environments, using Docker Compose is the most straightforward method to manage the application along with its dependencies (PostgreSQL and ClickHouse). You can find a template in the `deployments/docker-compose.yml` file.

### Kubernetes
Fivemanage Lite is stateless and can be easily deployed on Kubernetes. It is recommended to use a standard Deployment for the application and managed services for the database and storage. Ensure you configure the required environment variables via Secrets or ConfigMaps.
